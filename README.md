## 2017 fall web programming final project

This project utilizes NodeJS with AngularJS cli, ExpressJS, and webpack for javascript packaging.
A user can login with facebook, display their profile, and post updates on their activities and meals. These are visible to other users who are logged in as
well.

Some concepts I made use of were Single page application developmemnt, as well as implementing a model/view/controller framework
for proper seperation of concerns.
